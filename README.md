# Landing Page Project

## Project Summary

This is a multi-section landing page with dynamic navigation bar 

## Used technologies 

Html, Css and Javascript

## App js file

I used ES6 Javascript to buid a dynamic navigation bar which update its item when a new content is added to the page.

When the user scrolls to any section, this section and its item on the navigation bar will be active.

I added a function to scroll smoothly to the wanted section.
